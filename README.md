# brand-new-car-price
This is DST-9 DreamTeam Car Project Repo

Experiment version: 10.

Description:

Stacking by mean over:
1. RandomForestRegressor with 500 estimators;
2. BaggingRegressor over ExtraTreeRegressor;
3. CatBoostRegressor with 500k iterations.

Score on Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-dst-car-price is 9.01463. Place 8.

Warning!!! To run our code on your machine first unzip next files:
1. data/auto_ru.zip
2. models/BaggingRegressor_v10.zip
3. models/CatBoostRegressor_v10.zip
4. RandomForestRegressor_v10.zip
5. catboost_info/catboost_training.zip
into the same folders.

The catboost_info folder contains data to visualize with TesnorBoard.
Look more about catboost and tensorboard binding on https://catboost.ai/docs/features/visualization_tensorboard.html.

Enjoy our solution and remember...

More time, less error, more profit!!!
